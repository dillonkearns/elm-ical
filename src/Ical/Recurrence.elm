{-| Types for iCal recurrence rules
([RFC 5545 Section 3.3.10](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10)).

[`RecurrenceRule`](#RecurrenceRule) is the transparent record returned by
[`Ical.Parser`](Ical-Parser) for reading parsed recurrence data.
[`Frequency`](#Frequency) and [`DaySpec`](#DaySpec) are also used when
building rules for generation via [`Ical.Rule`](Ical#Rule).

{-| A parsed recurrence rule (RRULE). This is the transparent record returned
by [`Ical.Parser`](Ical-Parser) for reading parsed rule data. For constructing
rules for generation, use [`Ical.Rule`](Ical#Rule) and its builder functions.

    { frequency = Weekly { every = 1, weekStart = Time.Mon }
    , end = Forever
    , byDay = [ Every Time.Mon ]
    , byMonthDay = []
    , byMonth = []
    , bySetPos = []
    , byHour = []
    , byMinute = []
    , bySecond = []
    , byYearDay = []
    , byWeekNo = []
    }

  - `byDay` — which days of the week (with optional ordinals for monthly/yearly).
  - `byMonthDay` — which days of the month (1–31, or -31 to -1 from month end).
  - `byMonth` — which months.
  - `bySetPos` — pick the Nth result from the set produced by the other `by*`
    parts within each frequency period. Positive counts from the start, negative
    from the end. For example, `BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR` with `bySetPos = [ -1 ]`
    means "the last weekday" of each period.
  - `byHour` — which hours (0–23).
  - `byMinute` — which minutes (0–59).
  - `bySecond` — which seconds (0–60, 60 for leap second).
  - `byYearDay` — which days of the year (1–366, or -366 to -1 from year end).
  - `byWeekNo` — which ISO week numbers (1–53, or -53 to -1 from year end).

{-| How often the event recurs. Each variant carries its own configuration:

  - `every` — the interval between occurrences (e.g. `every = 2` with `Weekly`
    means every other week). Must be at least 1.
  - `weekStart` — which day begins the week (only meaningful for `Weekly`).

    | Monthly { every : Int }
    | Yearly { every : Int }


{-| When the recurrence stops. `Count` and `Until*` are mutually exclusive per
[RFC 5545 Section 3.3.10](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10).

    -- every Monday
    Every Time.Mon

    -- the 2nd Sunday of the month
    Every2nd Time.Sun

    -- the last Friday of the month
    EveryLast Time.Fri

Positive ordinals (`Every1st` through `Every5th`) count from the start of the
month. Negative ordinals (`EveryLast` through `Every5thToLast`) count from the
end.
